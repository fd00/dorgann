# Writes gh-pages's CNAME file so GitHub Pages serves this site at the
# custom domain (dist.yacp.dev) instead of the default yacp-dev.github.io/
# dist. gh-pages is rebuilt as a fresh orphan commit and force-pushed on
# every publish (publish_gh_pages.sh, doc/spec.md 3.3), but
# checkout_gh_pages.sh clones the *existing* tree into --dir first, so a
# previously-written CNAME already round-trips through that on its own --
# this step exists to (re-)create it after gh-pages doesn't exist yet
# (checkout_gh_pages.sh's from-scratch bootstrap path) or if it's ever
# removed by hand. Idempotent -- safe to run on every publish, same
# pattern as ensure_pages_enabled.sh.
#
# Usage: ensure_gh_pages_cname.sh --dir gh-pages --domain dist.yacp.dev
