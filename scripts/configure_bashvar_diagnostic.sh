# Points RUBYOPT at scripts/bashvar_diagnostic_patch.rb for the rest of
# this job, via GITHUB_ENV rather than just this step's own `env:` --
# every later `xezat` invocation (prep/bump/validate/port all call
# Xezat#variables, which is what crashes -- see that file's own header
# for the full story) needs to pick up the workaround, not just the very
# next one.
#
# Usage: configure_bashvar_diagnostic.sh (no arguments; run from the
# dorgann checkout root, i.e. build-package.yml's default working
# directory, same as every other scripts/*.sh reference in that file)
