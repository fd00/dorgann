#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Finds the open `build-failed` Issue (doc/spec.md 4.5) for a given
# package, if one exists. Shared by report_build_failure.sh (reuse instead
# of piling up a duplicate Issue on every repeat failure) and
# close_failure_issue.sh (close it once a later build succeeds).
#
# Issues are matched by the package field inside their `dorgann-meta` HTML
# comment -- a literal JSON substring match, not a regex or a title search
# -- since doc/spec.md 4.5 treats that comment as the source of truth for
# machine parsing (the title also carries the version, so it changes on
# every failure, and a Markdown table can be mis-parsed if formatting
# breaks). JSON is decoded with jq --arg rather than interpolated into a
# jq program string, so a package name can't break out of the filter.
#
# Usage: find_failure_issue.sh --repo fd00/dorgann --package foo
# Output: the issue number on stdout if found; nothing (exit 0) if not.
