# frozen_string_literal: true

# Works around (and diagnoses) BashVar.parse crashing outright on a
# single invalid UTF-8 byte anywhere in cygport's `bashvar` dump
# (compgen -v | declare -p every shell variable -- see xezat's own
# share/xezat/bashvar.sh) -- BashVar.parse's very first line calls
# .strip on the WHOLE blob (bashvar-0.1.1's lib/bashvar.rb:8), so one bad
# byte in ANY variable (this dumps every shell variable in scope, not
# just this package's own cygport ones -- confirmed against a real
# failure, libgedit-amtk 5.10.0, yacp-dev/dist's own build-package.yml run
# 32853901332, and against the committed cygport file itself decoding as
# clean UTF-8, ruling out the package's own content) kills parsing
# entirely, with cygport prep (and xezat bump/validate/port, which all
# call Xezat#variables too) aborting with no indication of which
# variable or why.
#
# Deliberately never logs variable VALUES, only names/byte positions --
# this repo's CI logs are public (yacp-dev/dist, fd00/yacp), and
# `compgen -v` can pick up ambient runner-injected tokens (e.g.
# ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN) that GitHub Actions' own secret-masking isn't
# guaranteed to cover, since masking is keyed off exact known `secrets.*`
# values, not every ambient env var a third-party action might set.
#
# Loaded via RUBYOPT=-r<this file> (build-package.yml), which preloads
# before xezat's own `require 'bashvar'` -- reopening the class here
# still takes effect regardless of require order, since a later
# `require 'bashvar'` is then just a no-op against the already-loaded
# (and now patched) class.
