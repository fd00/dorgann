#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Writes a short "what happened" summary (yacp PR link, build-failed
# Issue link) to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY, which GitHub renders as Markdown
# right at the top of the run page -- unlike a plain log line, which
# stays buried until someone opens this specific job and finds the right
# step.
#
# A real script file rather than an inline `run: |` block on purpose
# (doc/spec.md 5's own policy) -- the first attempt inlined this directly
# in build-package.yml and hit a real CRLF failure: `shell: bash` on this
# runner resolves to Cygwin's own (strict, CRLF-intolerant) bash once
# Cygwin is installed, but the temp script GitHub's own runner generates
# for a multi-line `run: |` block is written CRLF on Windows -- fine for
# the more lenient Git-for-Windows bash every *other* step in this
# workflow defaults to, fatal for Cygwin's ("line 1: $'{\r': command not
# found", confirmed by a real run). A checked-out script file doesn't
# have this problem: .gitattributes already guarantees it's LF, and it's
# invoked the same single-line `bash -- scripts/foo.sh` way as every
# other script in this workflow.
#
# pr_url/issue_url are each meant to be the concatenation of the (at most
# one non-empty) PR/Issue step outputs in build-package.yml -- whichever
# mutually exclusive success/failure-path step actually ran is the one
# whose output survives -- so an empty string here just means that kind
# of link doesn't apply to this run, not an error.
#
# artifact_id is Upload dist artifact's own step output -- always passed
# when set, but only worth printing a ready-to-run publish command for
# when there's no PR (validate_only, doc/spec.md 4.4.2's "semi-automated"
# path assumes a PR body carries this same command otherwise, e.g. Create
# Pull Request's own body already includes it) -- otherwise this would
# just be a redundant duplicate of what the PR body already says.
#
# Usage:
#   write_job_summary.sh --package foo --pr-url <url-or-empty> --issue-url <url-or-empty> [--artifact-id <id-or-empty>]
