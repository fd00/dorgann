# Downloads and extracts a dist artifact produced by build-package.yml,
# given its artifact ID (doc/spec.md 4.4.2 -- the ID visible in the URL
# when opening the artifact's download link on the Actions run page).
#
# Looks up the artifact's own workflow run via the Actions API first,
# rather than hitting the artifact zip-download endpoint directly, so
# `gh run download` (well-tested, handles auth/retries itself) can do the
# actual fetch.
#
# Refuses an expired artifact outright: dist artifacts expire under the
# default 90-day retention (doc/spec.md 4.4), so running this more than
# 90 days after the build means the artifact is already gone and the
# package needs to be rebuilt instead.
#
# Usage:
#   download_dist_artifact.sh --repo fd00/dorgann --artifact-id 12345 --dest artifact
