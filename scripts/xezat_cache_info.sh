#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Computes what's needed to cache xezat's gem install (including
# rugged/charlock_holmes's compiled native extensions, not just their
# source) across workflow runs, and to make the gems' executables (xezat
# itself included) runnable from later steps:
#
#   - gem_home: the Windows-style path to Ruby's gem directory, for
#     actions/cache's `path:` input (which needs a real filesystem path,
#     not a Cygwin one).
#   - gem_bindir: where `gem install` puts executables. Neither
#     Gem.user_dir + "/bin" nor `gem environment`'s "EXECUTABLE
#     DIRECTORY" (/usr/bin) match this -- Cygwin's system-wide gem
#     config forces every install to add `--user-install --bindir
#     $HOME/bin` (visible as `gem environment`'s GEM CONFIGURATION entry
#     `"gem" => "--user-install --bindir /home/runneradmin/bin"`),
#     overriding RubyGems' own default and confirmed by the actual "gem
#     install" warning ("You don't have /home/runneradmin/bin in your
#     PATH") in a real run. Each workflow step is its own bash invocation
#     (started fresh via `bash -- script.sh`, not a login/interactive
#     shell), so nothing sources a profile that would normally add this
#     to PATH -- without it, e.g. `xezat prep` fails with "xezat: command
#     not found" even though `gem install xezat` just succeeded.
#     Appending it to GITHUB_PATH here makes it available to every later
#     step in the job, not just the current one.
#   - version_hash: a fingerprint of every installed Cygwin package's
#     version, plus xezat's own GitHub HEAD commit (see
#     scripts/xezat_install.sh, which installs straight from
#     https://github.com/fd00/xezat.git rather than a pinned RubyGems.org
#     release). Native extensions are compiled against specific library
#     ABIs (Ruby itself, ICU, ...), and cygwin-install-action always
#     installs whatever's current on the mirror rather than pinned
#     versions, so a cached binary from a previous run could silently be
#     ABI-incompatible with a newer install; folding the Cygwin package
#     versions into the cache key means any such change naturally
#     invalidates the cache instead of restoring a broken extension.
#     Folding in xezat's HEAD commit the same way means a new xezat
#     commit invalidates the cache too -- otherwise, once a run had cached
#     some old HEAD's install, xezat_install.sh cloning a newer HEAD would
#     never actually get used: the cache restore runs before it and would
#     keep winning.
#
# Usage: xezat_cache_info.sh (no arguments; run after all Cygwin packages
# needed for xezat are installed)
#
# Output: prints "gem_home=...", "gem_bindir=..." and "version_hash=..."
# to stdout; if GITHUB_OUTPUT is set, appends the same there; if
# GITHUB_PATH is set, appends gem_bindir there too.
